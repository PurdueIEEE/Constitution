\article*{Preamble}
\label{art:preamble}

Purdue IEEE Student Branch has adopted the following bylaws to supplement the Constitution of IEEE.

\article{Executive Committee Bylaws}
\label{art:excom}


\section{Rakos Funding Distribution Act}
\label{byl:Rakos}
Any funding received from any source that is made out to our IEEE student branch without explicitly mentioning a committee or specific entity (rather on the account statement or other communication) to receive the funds shall adhere to the following procedures.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The funding shall be split exclusively and evenly between committees who have contacted the company or source for funding or sponsorship within the previous 10 months.
    \item If no committee has contacted the company within the previous 10 months but has previously received funding from the same company due to previous contact, they shall receive 50\% of the funding and the remainder shall be given to the student branch as a whole.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If multiple committees have contacted said source prior to the ten month period, then the 50\% of the funding shall be split evenly between these multiple committees.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Otherwise the money shall be given the student branch as a whole.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The proceeding point will not prohibit the Executive Committee from voting to redistribute the funding as desired; any such vote is strongly encouraged to split the funds evenly between the technical committees. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
