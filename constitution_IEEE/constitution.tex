    \item If multiple committees are in the aforementioned situation, then 50\% of the funding shall be split evenly between these multiple committees.

    \item Should the current President become unable to serve without nominating a successor the Vice President shall assume the Presidency.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Should both of those offices be vacant, then the succession proceeds down to the Treasurer, Secretary, Industrial Relations Head, Growth and Engagement Head, Learning Head, and Social Head in turn.
        \item The new President may then nominate a successor to the former office he or she held and any other vacant office subject to an ECMV.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Ad Hoc Committees}
\label{sec:exec_adhoc}
