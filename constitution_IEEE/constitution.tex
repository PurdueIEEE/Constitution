No term limits apply to these positions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Voting Procedures}
\label{sec:exec_vote}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A quorum is defined as one greater than half of the voting Executive Committee members. A quorum is necessary for the proceedings of any Executive Committee meeting to be binding.
    \item Presence for a vote shall be defined as the ability to communicate via the indicated meeting format (e.g., in-person, video conference, etc.).

    \item An officer or committee chair may be recalled from office when at least five members collectively request a recall vote. At least one week must elapse between the announcement of a recall vote including the manner in which it will be held and the vote itself. Recalled officers or committee chairs may not nominate successors and may additionally be subject to the disciplinary actions given in Article \ref{art:members}, Section \ref{sec:mem_discip} provided that the conditions given in said section are met.
    \item One manner of successful recall vote is by ECSV in favor of removing that member. In this case, the elected officer or committee chair in question may not vote. Alternatively, a general assembly of IEEE members that includes at least two members from each technical committee not serving on the Executive Committee may recall an elected officer with a two-thirds vote.
    \item Should the current President become unable to serve without nominating a successor the Vice President shall assume the Presidency.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Should both of those offices be vacant, then the succession proceeds down to the Treasurer, Secretary, Professional Head, Learning Head, and Social Head in turn.

    \item Similar to the technical committees, the Cornerstones committees must secure their own funds, operate within their own budget, and deliver a budget to the Treasurer within the first week of the academic year.
    \item Cornerstones committees may plan on assistance from the organization as a whole due to their inclusions of all members.
    \item The Executive Committee has fourteen days to decide on the exact amount the student branch will support each Cornerstones committee after receiving the respective budget. Upon receiving notice of the amount of financial support, that Cornerstones committee is responsible for raising the remaining income required or in seven days must adjust their projected expenditures.
\end{itemize}


\article{Technical Committees}
\label{art:technical}

\section{Basic Powers}
\label{sec:tech_pow}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standing technical committees may be established by an elected officer majority vote (EOMV) to be founded under the goals and leadership of the committee chair that the elected officers choose.
    \item These standing committees may be disbanded upon mutual agreement of the President and the corresponding committee chair so long as the latter position is filled or upon an Executive Committee supermajority vote (ECSV).
    \item The practice of establishing co-chairs of technical committees is discouraged.
    \item Should multiple people chair a technical committee, the single vote of the committee will be decided by a runoff between all the co-chairs prior to tallying the Executive Committee votes.
    \item Vice chairs are allowed but will not be given any voting rights at the Executive Committee level.
\end{itemize}

\section{Internal Governance}
\label{sec:tech_govern}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical committees shall select their own chair by election time each year.
    \item The committee chair shall establish a method of governance for the committee consistent with this Constitution.
    \item Each committee is responsible for outlining its own goals and purposes and drawing membership from the Student Branch as a whole.
    \item Formal procedures must be added to bylaws specific to the technical committee as mentioned in Article \ref{art:amend}, Section \ref{sec:amend_techbylaw}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Internal Operations}
\label{sec:tech_operate}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notwithstanding explicit constitutional provisions, technical committees shall have the ability to operate independently of approval from the Executive Committee but with operations visible to the elected officers.
    \item Each technical committee may determine its own requirements for committee membership and schedule for events and meetings.
    \item Each committee chair shall report the activities, meetings, and communications of its committee to the officers and other committee chairs.
    \item Furthermore, the committee chair shall make an effort to educate members about the opportunities the Cornerstones committees and international IEEE offer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Committee Budgets}
\label{sec:tech_budget}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each committee is expected to operate within its own budget as part of the operations of IEEE.
    \item Each committee should advance its budget to the IEEE Treasurer within the first week of each new academic year.
    \item In accordance with the guidelines imposed by the Business Office of Student Organizations, the Treasurer must make deposits and authorize expenditures for all committees.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limits to Independent Representation}
\label{sec:tech_limrepres}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical committees may participate in competitions, exhibitions, and the like under their own names rather than that of the Purdue IEEE Student Branch if the organization as a whole is not actively participating in such events.
    \item The committee chair is responsible for securing permission from the President and Primary Advisor if needed.
    \item The Executive Committee should restrain itself from disrupting prior arrangements of technical committees.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the Executive Committee or a group of technical committees is considering participation in a competition, exhibition, or the like for which a single technical committee is considering, the Executive Committee has seven days from the time of initial notification to decide via an ECSV on the participation of Purdue IEEE Student Branch or committees as a whole.
        \item Should such a vote pass, then the responsibility for communication, planning, execution, and expenses regarding the event shifts over to the Executive Committee.
        \item In all other circumstances, the right of the technical committee to independent representation is upheld.
    \end{itemize}
    \item No technical committee chair may include the word ``President'' in his or her internal title but is otherwise free to represent himself or herself when the technical committee operates under its own name.
\end{itemize}

\section{Joint Projects}
\label{sec:tech_joint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joint projects between student organizations, academic bodies, or off-campus entities of a scope in time, labor, or cost that the Executive Committee deems significant shall be formalized in a project charter.
    \item Project charters should cover the allotment of participating members, finances, tools, workspace, and other resources.
    \item Concerns such as project ownership and duration should be addressed within.
    \item Project charters should be signed by the appropriate representatives of the Executive Committee following passage and the corresponding governing bodies of other student organizations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Committee Good Standing}
\label{sec:tech_goodstand}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A technical committee may lose its good standing with the Student Branch by an EOMV.
    \item Reasons for losing good standing include but are not limited to: continued member absence from IEEE meetings, closing operations from the view of elected officers, failure to provide required members to the Cornerstones committees, willful disregard of the Constitution, continued bankruptcy of its accumulated funds, or failure to follow established bylaws.
    \item A technical committee that has lost its good standing will forfeit representation on the Executive Committee, be denied making future purchases, be prevented from bidding for unallocated funding or resources in possession of the organization as a whole, and lose access to room reservations and other systems used on behalf of IEEE.
    \item A technical committee will regain its good standing after another EOMV.
\end{itemize}


\article{Meetings}
\label{art:meet}

The Student Branch shall hold regular and special meetings beyond the meetings of the technical committees at such places and time as designated by the President, with a minimum of five meetings per academic year.
